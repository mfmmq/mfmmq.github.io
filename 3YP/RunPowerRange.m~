% Equivalence ratio is the fuel:air/stochiometric fuel:air ratio
% This should fall between 0.765 and 1.1 (from experimental data)
% Ammonia is flow rate of ammonia in kmol/s

% Design point will probably be Eq. Ratio = 0.9 ie inlet air flow of 4kmol
% (currently the designed inlet flow)

% I have yet to decide this because I'm not sure what the average flow rate
% will be/average power requirement
