%fillImage Takes in a Calibration grid definition and positions the camera
%so that the image of the grid fills the camera image.

% T_ow is the Calibration Grid frame
% KMatrix is the intrinsic camera model

% CameraHeight and CameraWidth are the sizes of the image in pixels

% Define the Left Top, Left Bottom, Right Top, and Right Bottom of the grid
